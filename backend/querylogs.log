The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.</p> <p>The GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section> <div> <h2>Disasters Applications</h2> <div> <div><div><div><ul> <li>GPM's Microwave Imager (GMI) can measure rainfall rates within storm systems to quantify the impact of tropical cyclones and other storm systems.</li> <li>GMI data is integrated into multiple Numerical Weather Prediction models&nbsp;to&nbsp;initialize weather&nbsp;forecasts&nbsp;with&nbsp;observational&nbsp; data and improve&nbsp;storm track prediction, including the Naval Research Lab (NRL) Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system (ATCF), the&nbsp;Joint&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for Satellite&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Assimilation&nbsp;(JCSDA/NOAA) Global&nbsp;Data Assimilation&nbsp;System (GDAS),&nbsp;and the&nbsp;European&nbsp;Centre for&nbsp;Medium-Range&nbsp;Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (<a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/610/applied-sciences/mission_applications_materials/GPMApplicationsExamples22017.pdf\">https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/610/applied-sciences/mission_applications_materials/GPMApplicationsExamples22017.pdf</a>)&nbsp;</li> <li>GPM's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) can measure size and distribution of hydrometeors within clouds in 3D, and can differentiate between liquid and frozen precipitation.

Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the GPM concept centers on the deployment of a “Core” satellite carrying an advanced radar / radiometer system to measure precipitation from space and serve as a reference standard to unify precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites. Through improved measurements of precipitation globally, the GPM mission is helping to advance our understanding of Earth's water and energy cycle, improve forecasting of extreme events that cause natural hazards and disasters, and extend current capabilities in using accurate and timely information of precipitation to directly benefit society. \n\nGPM Core Observatory overpass of Hurricane Florence from 9/14/18 at 18:36 UTC. Ground track shows rain rates (mm/hr) from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument, 3D swath shows rain rates in the atmospheric column from the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR).\n\nThe GPM Core Observatory carries the first space-borne Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and a multi-channel GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.\n\nThe GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.\n\nDisasters Applications\n\nGPM's Microwave Imager (GMI) can measure rainfall rates within storm systems to quantify the impact of tropical cyclones and other storm systems.\nGMI data is integrated into multiple Numerical Weather Prediction models to initialize weather forecasts with observational  data and improve storm track prediction, including the Naval Research Lab (NRL) Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system (ATCF), the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA/NOAA) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/610/applied-sciences/mission_applications_materials/GPMApplicationsExamples22017.pdf) \nGPM's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) can measure size and distribution of hydrometeors within clouds in 3D, and can differentiate between liquid and frozen precipitation. This helps to understand the structure and intensity of precipitation within storm systems to better understand how tropical cyclones form and intensify and to help quantify their impact (https://pmm.nasa.gov/articles/dive-360-view-hurricane-maria)    \n   The Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) dataset provides near-realtime global observations of rainfall at 10km resolution, which can be used to estimate total rainfall accumulation from storm systems and quantify the intensity of rainfall and flood impacts from tropical cyclones and other storm systems. (https://pmm.nasa.gov/articles/two-decades-precipitation-measurement)    \nIMERG  is used by the UMD Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS)  to detect potential flooding conditions and estimate intensity (http://flood.umd.edu/)      \nIMERG precipitation data is integrated into the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model to create landslide \"nowcasts\" that warn of potential landslide conditions around the world and provide situational awareness of landslide hazards. (https://pmm.nasa.gov/articles/modeling-landslide-threats-near-realtime)              \n\nLatest Updates\n\nThe NASA / JAXA GPM Core Observatory satellite flew over Hurricane Laura shortly before it made landfall at 10:00pm CT on Wednesday, August 26th, then again at 7:42am CT on Thursday, August 27th when it was over land, capturing data on precipitation within the storm. This visualization from the 10:00pm CT August 26 GPM overpass shortly before Laura made landfall shows GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) data (center track) overlaid on GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) data showing the intensity...\n\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is off to a busy start. By the first week of June, Tropical Storm Arthur had already brushed North Carolina, Tropical Storm Bertha had drenched South Carolina, and the third named storm of the year— Cristobal—was dropping torrential rain on the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm first developed in the Pacific in late May as Tropical Storm Amanda, spinning off the southern end of a seasonal low-pressure pattern called the Central American Gyre. After making landfall in Guatemala and causing deadly floods in El Salvador, Amanda weakened and became less organized as...\n\nNASA monitored the heavy rain associated with Tropical Cyclone Amphan as it made landfall at 0900 UTC (2:30 PM local time) on May 20, 2020. Landfall occurred near the India-Bangladesh border along the northern edge of the Bay of Bengal. At the time of the most recent satellite observation used to generate this image (0900 UTC, May 20), heavy rain had started falling along the coast but large accumulations had not yet occurred over land. So far the largest rainfall accumulation from Amphan has fallen over the Bay of Bengal on May 18 while Amphan was at category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.\n\nA Category 4 cyclone, the most powerful yet of 2020, made landfall on the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu on Monday, not long before this GPM overpass from April 6th, 2020 at 1:41 UTC. Tropical Cyclone Harold developed from a low pressure system that was observed to the east of Papua New Guinea last week, and has tracked to the southeast, where it has already caused flooding and loss of life in the Solomon Islands. Early reports from Vanuatu indicate heavy flooding and property damage.\n\nVideo of GPM Satellite observes Hurricane Dorian over the Bahamas   The NASA / JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory flew over Hurricane Dorian on September 1st (5:22pm ET / 21:22 UTC) as the storm was directly over Abaco Island in The Bahamas. The satellite captured data on rainfall rates within the storm as it flew over using its Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). In this animation the multi-satellite GPM IMERG product is shown first to illustrate rainfall rates prior to the overpass. When the camera zooms in data...\n\nUPDATE 9/5/19: Hurricane Dorian continues to generate tremendous amounts of rainfall, and has left over three feet of rain in some areas of the Bahamas and is now lashing the Carolinas. NASA’s IMERG product provided a look at those rainfall totals.\n\nNASA’s satellite-based estimates of global precipitation can provide valuable information to officials monitoring the many wildfires that have been scorching Alaska this summer. Although wildfires regularly occur every Alaskan summer, July 2019 proved a particularly active month. Few rain gauges exist in the remote expanses of Alaskan wilderness, but wildfires unchecked can spread to populated areas within the state. Satellite-based precipitation estimates are therefore particularly valuable because of precipitation's relationship to wildfire hazard. The embedded video, above, shows data...\n\nThis animation shows the heavy precipitation that Hurricane Barry produced from July 11-16 in the Gulf of Mexico and the southcentral United States. While forecasters were initially concerned that the largest accumulations would extend far over land, the heaviest rainfall  remained mostly offshore.  Precipitation estimates are derived from the GPM IMERG product, which combines microwave and infrared observations from an international constellation of satellites united by the GPM Core Observatory. The left side of the movie shows the total accumulation starting in the early hours of...\n\nGPM Core Observatory rainfall rates from Tropical Storm Barry captured July 11th, 2019 at 8:26am CT. Credit: Jacob Reed / NASA GSFC NASA / JAXA’s GPM Core Observatory passed over developing Tropical Depression 2 (which was upgraded to Tropical Storm Barry later in the morning) in the Gulf of Mexico the morning of July 11th 2019 at 8:26am CT, capturing estimates of rainfall rates within the storm. The first image shows rainfall rates collected by GPM’s Microwave Imager, while the second...\n\nThis rainfall accumulation analysis was derived from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) IMERG multi-satellite dataset. This analysis shows Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) rainfall accumulation estimates along Yutu’s track from October 21- 25, 2018 as it hit the Northern Mariana Islands. IMERG rainfall accumulation data indicated that Yutu frequently produced rainfall totals greater than 10 inches along it's current track.\n\nNASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core observatory satellite captured an image of Super Typhoon Yutu when it flew over the powerful storm just as the center was striking the central Northern Mariana Islands north of Guam. Early on October 25, 2018 Super Typhoon Yutu crossed over the U.S. commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. It was the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane. The National Weather Service in Guam said it was the strongest storm to hit any part of the U.S. this year.\n\nAt least eleven deaths have now been attributed to deadly hurricane Michael. Some casualties resulted not only from Michael's destructive winds and storm surges but also from the blinding rain that Michael produced as it battered states from Florida northeastward through Virginia. Today tropical storm Michael is moving out over the Atlantic Ocean and has transitioned into a powerful extratropical storm.   This animation using the GPM IMERG multi-satellite dataset shows the estimated total rainfall accumulation for...\n\nVideo of GPM Rainfall Data From Michael This animation shows the NASA Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) rainfall accumulation estimates from Hurricane Michael October 1- 5, 2018 when rainfall was getting more concentrated over the western Caribbean. The Global Precipitation Measurement mission or GPM's constellation of satellites provides rainfall data to make rainfall estimates. GPM is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA. IMERG indicated...\n\nThe GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) has 13 channels that view different aspects of the hurricane in different ways. This overpass of Hurricane Michael on Oct. 8th, 2018 shows the combined low, mid, and high-frequency GMI channels along with the retrieved rain rate for the same overpass developed by combining all channels to understand the precipitation structure.\n\nVideo of 7-Day Animation of Mangkhut Affecting the Philippines In the past week, Typhoon Mangkhut has affected the Philippines, mainland China, and Hong Kong, as shown in this 7-day animation of NASA's satellite-based IMERG precipitation product. The upper frame shows the storm-total accumulation starting at 0100 UTC on September 11, 2018. Storm-total accumulations in excess of 4 inches stretched from Manila to the northern tip of Luzon Island where the rainfall triggered deadly landslides. The lower frame shows the short-term accumulation in a 3-hour period that slides from the...\n\nUPDATE 9/18/18: Over the weekend #HurricaneFlorence brought torrential rains and record flooding to the Carolinas. This GPM IMERG visualization shows storm-total accumulated rainfall on the left for 9/12/18 - 9/17/18 vs. a sequence of 3-hour accumulations on the right https://t.co/numzHJXzb2 pic.twitter.com/pzAgkVrRXl— NASA Precipitation (@NASARain)...\n\nThe Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is an international network of satellites that provide the next-generation global observations of rain and snow. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the GPM concept centers on the deployment of a “Core” satellite carrying an advanced radar / radiometer system to measure precipitation from space and serve as a reference standard to unify precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites. Through improved measurements of precipitation globally, the GPM mission is...\n\nVideo of GPM Observes Tropical Storm Florence Temporarily Weakened by Wind Shear   GPM passed over Tropical Storm Florence on September 7, 2018. As the camera moves in on the storm, DPR's volumetric view of the storm is revealed. A slicing plane moves across the volume to display precipitation rates throughout the storm. Shades of green to red represent liquid precipitation. Frozen precipitation is shown in cyan and purple. NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement mission or GPM core observatory satellite flew over Tropical Storm Florence on September 7, 2018. At that time, the...\n\nGPM Core Observatory overpass of Hurricane Lane from Aug. 23rd, 2018 at 6:21am HST (local time). Battling increased vertical shear, Hurricane Lane struggles northward, down from its Category 5 peak but still featuring winds of over 110 knots. The storm has already begun impacting the Hawaiian Islands, bringing over a foot of rain to Hilo via its outer bands. Lane is expected to continue northward, approaching the island chain, before slowly veering...\n\nVideo of A Week of Heavy Rainfall Over Hawaiian Islands A low pressure trough moving slowly westward through the northwestern Hawaiian Islands caused destructive flooding and mudslides over the past weekend. The trough disrupted the normal northeast trade winds flow north of Oahu on April 12, 2018. This caused extremely heavy rainfall as the trough deepened and moved very slowly over Kauai during the weekend. The 28.1 inches (713 mm) of rain reported in Hanalei within a 24 hour period was close to a record for the small town on Kauai's northern coast. Almost 32.4 inches (822 mm) of...\n\nPages"

Devastating floods and landslides swept through parts of Kyushu on July 4, 2020, resulting in over 40 deaths and orders for hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes according to media reports. <a href=\"/sites/default/files/disaster-files/imerg_Meiyu-Baiu.mp4\">Download video</a>&nbsp;(right-click -&gt; Save As) The rains that triggered the flooding occurred in the context of the Meiyu-Baiu rainy season, which arrives in east Asia every year from June to mid-July. “Meiyu” and “Baiu” are the Chinese and Japanese words for “plum rains”, so called because the rains usually arrive around the time that plum trees ripen. The east-west rain bands that can be seen in the animation are characteristic of the Meiyu-Baiu season. Climate scientists have determined that these rain bands are forced by a combination of warm air from the Tibetan Plateau that travels along a jet of air running eastward, as well as moist tropical air from the southwest. While the Meiyu-Baiu rains had been active in southern Japan in the days leading up to the recent flooding, the period beginning with July 3, 2020 saw particularly intense periodic rain pulses with rates exceeding 25 mm/hr (1 inch/hr) in the areas around Kyushu. Accumulations increased rapidly from July 3—July 5, to over 40 cm (~16 inches) over the entire southern half of the island, with some areas reaching as high as 60 cm (~2 feet). NASA's IMERG algorithm combines data from an international constellation of satellites to show precipitation measurements both over the ocean and over land. </p> </div> <div> <div> <p><a href=\"/news/near-real-time-global-fire-emissions-data-now-available-nasa-disasters-mapping-portal\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the GFED product in the NASA Disasters Mapping portal\" height=\"124\" src=\"https://disasters.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/basic_page_images/GFED.jpg?itok=TmzD04h3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"220\"></a></p> </div> <p> Near real-time fire emissions products from the Global Fire Emissions Database (<a href=\"http://globalfiredata.org/\">GFED</a>) have recently been added to the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal, making it easier to for disaster researchers and responders to track aerosols and changes in greenhouse gases and air quality from fires around the world. This application from the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal animates the past week of GFED near real-time data. Carbon emissions are shown by default, but you can click the “layers” icon in the upper right to toggle the display of other emissions such as methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Credit: NASA <a href=\"https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov/arcgis/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e30dd7acb4c64abda3e732ec739cb656\">View on the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal</a> The dataset tracks six different emissions, which are carbon (C), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), dry matter (DM) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Data are presented in gigagrams (Gg) at 0.25° (~28km) resolution. Emissions data are updated daily and are available from January 2019 to present. Fire emissions estimates from the GFED near real-time product are based on active fire detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (<a href=\"https://disasters.nasa.gov/instruments/viirs\">VIIRS</a>) instruments aboard the Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. The historical relationship between VIIRS active fire detections and GFED emissions from 2012 – 2016 are used to create a statistical model which can convert active fire detections to biomass burned in near real-time. Long-term GFED emissions estimates are calculated using satellite burned area data and a carbon cycle model that cannot be produced in real-time.

      "text": "This animation shows NASA IMERG rain rates (blue shading) and accumulations (green shading) near Kyushu island, in the southwest of Japan from June 29 - July 5, 2020. Devastating floods and landslides swept through parts of Kyushu on July 4, 2020, resulting in over 40 deaths and orders for hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes according to media reports. Download video (right-click -> Save As) The rains that triggered the flooding occurred in the context of the Meiyu-Baiu rainy season, which arrives in east Asia every year from June to mid-July. “Meiyu” and “Baiu” are the Chinese and Japanese words for “plum rains”, so called because the rains usually arrive around the time that plum trees ripen. The east-west rain bands that can be seen in the animation are characteristic of the Meiyu-Baiu season. Climate scientists have determined that these rain bands are forced by a combination of warm air from the Tibetan Plateau that travels along a jet of air running eastward, as well as moist tropical air from the southwest. While the Meiyu-Baiu rains had been active in southern Japan in the days leading up to the recent flooding, the period beginning with July 3, 2020 saw particularly intense periodic rain pulses with rates exceeding 25 mm/hr (1 inch/hr) in the areas around Kyushu. Accumulations increased rapidly from July 3—July 5, to over 40 cm (~16 inches) over the entire southern half of the island, with some areas reaching as high as 60 cm (~2 feet). NASA's IMERG algorithm combines data from an international constellation of satellites to show precipitation measurements both over the ocean and over land.\n\nNear real-time fire emissions products from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) have recently been added to the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal, making it easier to for disaster researchers and responders to track aerosols and changes in greenhouse gases and air quality from fires around the world. This application from the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal animates the past week of GFED near real-time data. Carbon emissions are shown by default, but you can click the “layers” icon in the upper right to toggle the display of other emissions such as methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Credit: NASA View on the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal The dataset tracks six different emissions, which are carbon (C), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), dry matter (DM) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Data are presented in gigagrams (Gg) at 0.25° (~28km) resolution. Emissions data are updated daily and are available from January 2019 to present. Fire emissions estimates from the GFED near real-time product are based on active fire detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments aboard the Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. The historical relationship between VIIRS active fire detections and GFED emissions from 2012 – 2016 are used to create a statistical model which can convert active fire detections to biomass burned in near real-time. Long-term GFED emissions estimates are calculated using satellite burned area data and a carbon cycle model that cannot be produced in real-time.
